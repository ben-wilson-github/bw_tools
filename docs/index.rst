Overview
========
BWTools is a series of plugins for Substance Designer, aimed at speeding up graph organisation tasks.
The plugins come as a package which neatly slots directly into Designers UI,
where the user can set hotkeys for the various tools along with their associated settings.

If you have used an older version, please check out :doc:`changes_from_1x`.

The plugin is split into a series of modules, each designed to solve a particular problem.
Check out :doc:`usage` for a more detailed look at each of the tools.

I recommend looking at :doc:`general_guide` to get the most out of the tools.

If you are looking to work with the code or want to understand more,
check out my `git hub page <https://github.com/ben-wilson-github/bw_tools>`_
