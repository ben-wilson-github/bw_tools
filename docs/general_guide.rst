General Guide To Using The Tools
================================
The main purpose of the tools are to aid in your day to day graph organisation and optimisation tasks.
As such, the tools are best used frequently and on small tasks.

For example, when using the `BW Layout Graph_` tools,
it is often better to run them on small groups of nodes as a way to help speed up basic alignment tasks.

While the tool can run on large networks and node chains, every artist and material will have a unique structure and preference for graph layout.
For this reason, the tool is at its best when supplimenting your own layout preferences.

This is especially true for `BW Optimize Graph_` as this tool will delete duplicate node chains and thus modify the existing layout.
If you run this tool at the end of your work on a large graph, it may be difficult to see what was actually optimised away.
So again, it is better to optimise your work as you go.

`BW Straighten Connection_` is very useful for visually tidying up your graph, but it does however insert a lot of extra dot nodes.
So make sure you do not forget about the `Remove Connected Dot Nodes Hotkey_` feature to make handling the extra dot nodes easier.
